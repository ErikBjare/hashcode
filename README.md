# Solutions for previous Hashcode competitions

### 2016

Team:

 - Måns Magnusson ([exoji2e](https://github.com/exoji2e), captain)
 - Erk Bjäreholt ([ErikBjare](https://github.com/ErikBjare))
 - Viktor Brange
 - Johannes Ahnlide

First Hashcode competition, I (Erik) enjoyed the problem a lot but out team suffered greatly from a lack of time and our team only having 2 computers on a 4 person team. Pretty happy with the architecture though, although things got a bit messy at the end when time pressure kicked in.

Global rank: 373 out of 1054
